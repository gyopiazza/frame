--------------------------------------


PRIO A

IMPORTANT: Include grunt-newer in the tasks

Add 'environments' to the config files to load different files depending on the environment (especially useful for assets dev/live)

Add 'social sharing' links helper (from pins), also launch them in a popup (magnific popup)

Add automatic styleguide generator

Add automatic documentation generator

Add example widget to 'widgets'

Add application.version to the js/css assets
Add IE conditional assets loading (http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html)

Implement – somehow – the rewrite rules from pins

Fix admin_bar_logo


--------------------------------------


PRIO B

Reorganize files/folder... maybe move everything inside a "frame" folder?
Separate 'helpers' into api and helpers (?)

Add some plugins for development (duplicate post, regenerate thumbnails, cache, auto optimize, debug bar...)
Maybe move the 'plugins' folder inside 'library'

Add login background image option (or hook), or better add an admin_login_css file to be loaded

Move hooks.images_quality to config.media

Test functions conflict by duplicating the theme and launching the customizer

Add support for Polylang in helpers/frame_segments

Add cron config (?)

Rename all the hook functions to 'frame_hook_function_name'

Set application.version to the theme version by default, fetched from style.css
$my_theme = wp_get_theme(); $version = str_replace('.','_',$my_theme->get( 'Version' ));


--------------------------------------


TO CHECK:

Check if application.comments_trackbacks_support works properly

Test/Modify 'theme activation' page from roots (https://github.com/roots/roots/tree/master/lib)

Add gruntfile and prepare for SASS (check skyline.is and inuit)
