# Frame
A starter/parent theme for developers with a nicely organised structure and resources autoloading.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository
```
    git clone ...
```

NOTE: **Frame** comes preconfigured with **grunt**, **sass**, **minification** and other **Node** utilities. To implement a different system delete all the files/folders (also the invisible ones prefixed with dots) and just keep the **theme** folder.
